# ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING DEVOPS / SYSTEM EMGINEERING

This is a repo contains directories of projects on devops carried out during Software Engineering studies at ```ALX SE``` and ```Holberton School```.

In the projects in this repo, I'm system engineering as a skill in SWE and using the skills acquired to solve tasks that are in this repo.

# Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:
| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
[`command_line_for_the_win`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win) | A cool game challenge on bask skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills |
