# ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING / DEVOPS

This is a repo contains directories of projects on devops carried out during Software Engineering studies at ```ALX SE``` and ```Holberton School```.

In the projects in this repo, I'm learning system engineering as a skill in SWE and using the knowledge acquired to solve tasks that are in this repo.
