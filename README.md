# ALX SYSTEM ENGINEERING / DEVOPS

This is a repo contains directories of projects on devops carried out during Software Engineering studies at ```ALX SE``` and ```Holberton School```.

In the projects in this repo, I'm learning system engineering as a skill in SWE and using the knowledge acquired to solve tasks that are in this repo.

# Projects
All of the following directories are projects done during the studies:
| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
[`0x00-shell_basics`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x00-shell_basics) | **Introduction to shell**. Learning what is shell, shell navigation, looking around, manipulating files, working with commands, reading man pages and keyboard shortcuts for bash. |
[`0x01-shell_permissions`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x01-shell_permissions) | Learning commands `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp` , linux file permissions, represent sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit, changing permissions, owner and group of a file, running a command with root privileges and changing user ID or becoming superuser |
[`0x02-shell_redirections`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x02-shell_redirections) | Learning Shell input/output`(I/O)` redirections, special characters and man pages.|
[`0x03-shell_variables_expansions`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions) | Learning Shell Initialization Files, variables, expansion, shell arithmetics, the `alias` command and other `help` pages.|
[`0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing) | Understanding `SSH RSA` key pair, Bash scripting using different looping methods, conditions, parsing, comparison and file test operators. |
[`0x05-processes_and_signals`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x05-processes_and_signals) | Learning `PID`, Linux processes(Environment `extern`, `environ`, `getenv`, `setenv`), Environment list, Linux signals, commands for Process Management and Process States in Linux. |
[`0x06-regular_expressions`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x06-regular_expressions) | Understanding basics of Regular Expressions i.e `regex` including repetition, anchor, character, short character and lookaround and lookahead tokens as well as repetition quantifiers and group/back references. |
[`command_line_for_the_win`](https://github.com/iankisali/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win) | A cool game challenge on bask skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills |
